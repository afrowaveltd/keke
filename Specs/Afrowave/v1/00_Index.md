# Afrowave Framework – v1 Index

This document is the normative entry point for the Afrowave framework, version 1.

Afrowave defines the philosophical, ethical, cultural, and longevity principles that govern the entire project.

## Scope of v1

Afrowave v1 defines:

- core principles and values
- ethical constraints
- naming and language rules
- long-term compatibility philosophy

Afrowave v1 does NOT define:

- protocol mechanics
- routing algorithms
- implementation details

## Documents in this specification

The following documents together form Afrowave v1:

1. Core Principles
2. Ethical Rules
3. Naming Charter
4. Longevity and Compatibility Doctrine

All documents listed above are normative unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Governance principle

Afrowave principles override implementation convenience.

If a technical decision conflicts with Afrowave values, the values take precedence.

## Status

Afrowave v1 is stable and intended to be timeless.

Revisions may clarify language, but core principles must not be weakened or removed.
