- Military organizations
- Intelligence agencies
- Secret services
- Law enforcement agencies
- Border control agencies
- Surveillance authorities
- Internal security forces

------------------------------------------------------------

4. PENALTY FOR VIOLATION

Any state or state-controlled entity found to be in violation of this license
agrees to an immediate and irrevocable penalty equal to:

FOUR PERCENT (4%) of its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

This penalty is considered liquidated damages for irreversible moral and
humanitarian harm.

The existence of a potential settlement option under Section 5A does not
limit, suspend, or diminish the applicability of this penalty.

------------------------------------------------------------


4A. AGGRAVATED LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF LIFE

If a violation of this license has led, directly or indirectly, to the loss
of human life or lives, the penalty defined in Section 4 SHALL be subject to
mandatory escalation as follows:

a) For every commenced increment of ONE THOUSAND (1,000) human fatalities
   attributable, directly or indirectly, to the violation, the penalty
   amount SHALL BE DOUBLED.

b) The escalation described in subsection (a) is cumulative and applies
   sequentially per each additional commenced increment of 1,000 fatalities.

c) Attribution includes, but is not limited to:

   - direct operational use
   - logistical, infrastructural, or informational support
   - enabling, facilitating, or accelerating harmful actions
   - foreseeable secondary or downstream effects

d) Intent, claimed neutrality, or asserted lack of direct control SHALL NOT
   exempt the violating entity from escalated liability.

e) In cases covered by this Section, ANY form of settlement, mitigation,
   reduction, or humanitarian compromise as described in Section 5A is
   STRICTLY PROHIBITED and SHALL NOT be offered.

f) The penalty resulting from this Section is considered proportional to the
   irreversible nature of the harm caused and reflects the principle that
   loss of human life cannot be offset by negotiation.

5. ALLOCATION OF PENALTY FUNDS

Any funds collected under Section 4 MUST be allocated as follows:

- 10% for improvement of Afrowave infrastructure
- 10% placed into a transparent financial reserve account
- 80% dedicated exclusively to humanitarian projects

Humanitarian projects are selected by the Afrowave community and MAY, but
are NOT REQUIRED to, include projects within the violating state.

------------------------------------------------------------

5A. CONDITIONAL HUMANITARIAN SETTLEMENT OPTION

This Section SHALL NOT apply in any case involving loss of human life as
defined in Section 4A.

Notwithstanding Section 4, Afrowave MAY, at its sole discretion, offer a
conditional humanitarian settlement in cases where enforcement of the
penalty would primarily harm the civilian population of the violating state,
including but not limited to developing or economically vulnerable countries.

a) A settlement MAY be offered only after a violation has been established
   or acknowledged.

b) The settlement SHALL NOT reduce the severity of the violation and SHALL
   NOT constitute a waiver of responsibility.

c) The minimum condition for any settlement is a demonstrable commitment to
   invest at least FIFTY PERCENT (50%) of the penalty amount defined in
   Section 4 within a maximum period of FIVE (5) YEARS.

d) All investments under this settlement MUST be directed exclusively to
   projects selected by the Afrowave community through a transparent public
   voting process.

e) In the voting process described in subsection (d):
   - each verified participant residing in the violating state SHALL have
     a voting weight equal to FIVE (5) standard votes;
   - all other participants SHALL have a voting weight of one (1).

f) Settlement investments MUST be:
   - verifiable,
   - publicly auditable,
   - reported at regular intervals,
   - subject to independent review.

g) Failure to meet any settlement condition SHALL result in immediate
   termination of the settlement and full enforcement of the original
   penalty defined in Section 4.

h) The availability of this settlement option is an act of humanitarian
   consideration and SHALL NOT be interpreted as leniency toward the
   violating entity.

6. NO WAIVER, NO GENERAL EXCEPTIONS

No emergency, national security claim, legal mandate, or internal regulation
may override this license, EXCEPT as explicitly defined in Section 6A.


------------------------------------------------------------

6A. LIMITED HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY EXCEPTION

Notwithstanding Sections 2 and 3, Afrowave MAY, at its sole discretion,
grant a TEMPORARY and LIMITED exception to the restricted use prohibition
under the following strictly defined conditions:

a) The exception is granted exclusively for non-political, humanitarian
   purposes in situations of extreme and immediate risk, including but
   not limited to:
   - imminent loss of life or serious injury
   - large-scale natural disasters
   - fires, floods, earthquakes, or similar catastrophes
   - terrorist, military, or other violent attacks causing civilian harm
   - prevention of substantial and immediate property destruction

b) Any granted exception MUST:
   - be explicitly requested
   - define a precise scope of permitted use
   - be bound to a specific emergency situation
   - include a defined and time-limited validity period
     (which may be adjusted if circumstances evolve)

c) The exception is strictly non-transferable and applies only to the
   explicitly authorized entities, systems, and purposes.

d) Afrowave reserves the unconditional right to:
   - immediately revoke the exception
   - immediately suspend or terminate access to services or infrastructure

   if:
   - the exception is misused
   - false or misleading information was provided
   - Afrowave principles or ethical rules are violated
   - continued use presents a moral, humanitarian, or civil risk

e) Revocation requires no notice and no justification beyond Afrowave’s
   determination that the conditions of this exception are no longer met.

f) Any misuse or abuse of this exception SHALL be treated as a direct
   violation of this license and SHALL trigger the penalties defined
   in Section 4.


7. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this license is held unenforceable by a court, all
remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

------------------------------------------------------------

8. ETHICAL SUPREMACY CLAUSE

If a use case is legally permitted but ethically questionable, it is
considered prohibited under this license.

------------------------------------------------------------

9. ACCEPTANCE

Use, modification, distribution, or implementation of this software
constitutes full and unconditional acceptance of this license.
